{"summary":[{"Summary":" As a seasoned software engineer at Fortune 500 companies, I have contributed to more than 30 professional projects as a team member and have developed more than 20 utility tools as an individual. I spend most of my time developing frameworks\\platforms, client-server applications and auxiliary tools. I am thoughtful, insofar as trying to use the best algorithms and design patterns, as well as pragmatic to ship the product on time. I label myself as a curious engineer who can make quick hacks using libraries or spend hours to prove a greedy algorithm. I participate in competitive programming through codeforces and TopCoder. I also maintain my academic bonds through open MOOC platforms such as Coursera and Udacity.\n\n"}],"education_and_training":[{"Certifications":" C# 4.0 Master Brainbench License 7691089 November 2012 ASP.NET 4.0 Brainbench License 7691089 February 2013 JavaScript 1.5 BrainBench License 7691089 October 2012 SQL Server 2008 Programming BrainBench License 7691089 August 2012 Design Patterns Brainbench License 7691089 C# 3.0 Master Brainbench License 7691089 January 2012 Object Oriented Concepts Brainbench License 7691089 SQL Server 2005 Programming Brainbench License 7691089 .NET framework Fundamentals Brainbench License 7691089 Presentation Skills BrainBench License 7691089 Project Management Brainbench License 7691089 UML Brainbench License 7691089 Business Communication Brainbench License 7691089 Business Mathematics Brainbench License 7691089\n\nPage4\n\nMicroEconomic principles Coursera - University of Illinois Urbana Champaign\n\n"},{"Courses":"\n\nIndependent Coursework\n\nPage5\n\nDesign of Programming Languages CS212\n\n"},{"Education":" ICFAI University Post Graduate Diploma, Logistics, Materials, and Supply Chain Management, 2006 - 2007 Grade: 3.5 Anna University Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.), Electrical and Electronics Engineering, "}],"skills":[{"Skills & Expertise":" Microsoft SQL Server C# ASP.NET ASP.NET MVC jQuery JavaScript Python HTML CSS3 .NET CLR NUnit Managed Extensibility Framework Design Patterns Data Driven Testing LINQ MSBuild Regular Expressions Bash CSS Database Design Software Development\n\nPage6\n\n"},{"Languages":" English (Full professional proficiency) Tamil (Professional working proficiency) French (Elementary proficiency)\n\n"},{"Programming Languages":" CS262\n\nSoftware Debugging CS259\n\nAdvanced Design and Analysis of Algorithms from Stanford Online\n\n"}],"basics":{"gender":"male","name":{"firstName":"Antony","surname":"Thomas","middleName":"Deepak"},"title":"Software Engineer","email":["antonydeepak@gmail.com"]},"work_experience":[{"date_start":"August 2013","jobtitle":"Software Engineer","text":" - Present (1 year 6 months)\n\nWorked in developing Advertising SDK and experiences for Xbox360.
