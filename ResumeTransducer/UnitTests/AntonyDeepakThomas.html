<p>Summary
As a seasoned software engineer at Fortune 500 companies, I have contributed to more than 30 professional
 projects as a team member and have developed more than 20 utility tools as an individual. I spend most of my
 time developing frameworks\platforms, client-server applications and auxiliary tools. I am thoughtful, insofar
 as trying to use the best algorithms and design patterns, as well as pragmatic to ship the product on time.  I
 label myself as a curious engineer who can make quick hacks using libraries or spend hours to prove a greedy
 algorithm. I participate in competitive programming through codeforces and TopCoder. I also maintain my
 academic bonds through open MOOC platforms such as Coursera and Udacity.
